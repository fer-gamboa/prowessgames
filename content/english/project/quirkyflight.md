Get ready to fly alongside Quirky through increasingly difficult and longer levels in Normal Mode, and to challenge yourself to flight your way through neverending obstacles in Endless Mode.



**★ SIMPLE CONTROLS:**
Tap tap, tap your way. No hard-to-learn controls. Just tap in the top half of your screen, and Quirky flies higher. Tap in the bottom half, and it flies lower.

**★ EXCITING MANOUVERS:**
Become the quirkiest pilot and help Quirky avoid cumbersome enemies and gravity-defiant obstacles.

**★ BEAT YOUR PAST SELF:**
How long can you endure in Endless Mode? With no finish line in sight, help Quirky avoid unending challenges in this game mode. Beat your older best scores and rank up!

**★ PLAY FOR FREE:**
No in-app purchases, and no pesky banners. You can watch short ads to refill your diamonds and play without waiting.
